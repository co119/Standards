# Estimating

## Protocol

### 1. Request

When a **Salesperson** or **Client Advisor** needs to request an estimate from the production team, they _must_ follow this process...

1. Add an task into [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) under `Company 119 -> Estimates -> [project_type] Estimates`. This *must* be in this area or the estimate *will not* get completed in a timely fashion.
3. Enter all pertinent details of the request to the task's description
4. Add the "estimating" tag to the task
5. Assign the task to the appropriate **Project Manager** depending on the project type (REC, RAO, 1X, or MNT)
6. Assign a due date of the same day for tasks created before 4 p.m. and a due date of the next business day for tasks created after 4 p.m.

### 2. Acknowledgement

When the estimator receives a new estimating request, they must ackownledge receipt of the request following Company 119's defined [Communication Rules](/processes/communication).

### 3. Assessment

Within 24-hours of receiving the estimating request, the estimator _must_ begin reviewing the request. From here, there are two paths...

#### More Details Are Needed...

The estimator must request the details through [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) following these steps:

1. Tag the requestor in the comment
1. List the additional details needed
1. Assign comment to the requestor
1. Add the tag of 'question' to the task

Once the requestor provides the details, repeat the Assessment step until no additional details are required to complete the estimating task.

#### No Additional Details Needed...

The estimator must notify the requestor within [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) when the estimate will be ready for internal review following these steps:

1. Tag the requestor in the comment
1. Inform the requestor what date they will receive the estimate (this cannot be farther out than 24 hours from the current date)
1. Set the task due date to be the same as above

### 4. Build & Respond

Once all the details are gathered and before the due date, the estimator will build the estimate and provide the estimated hours to the requestor via [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/).

### Addendum: REC/RAO Estimating Goals

The following are the goals for the REC/RAO team:

* Costing received by 3 p.m. Monday-Thursday will be turned around the same day with the exception of special circumstances. Costing received after 3 p.m. Monday-Thursday will be turned around by the end of the business next day. In the case of special circumstances, a new due date will be agreed upon by the requestor and the estimator.
* Costing received by noon Friday will be turned around the same day with the exception of special circumstance. Costing received after 3 p.m. Friday will be turned around by the end of the business next day. In the case of special circumstances, a new due date will be agreed upon by the requestor and the estimator.
