1. Add an task into [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) under `Company 119 -> Estimates -> [project_type] Estimates`
1. Enter all pertinent details of the request should be added to the task's description
1. Add the "estimating" tag to the task
1. Assign the task to the appropriate **Project Manager** depending on the project type (REC, RAO, 1X, or MNT)

### 2. Acknowledgement

When the estimator receives a new estimating request, they must ackownledge receipt of the request following Company 119's defined [Communication Rules](/processes/communication).

### 3. Assessment

Within 24-hours of receiving the estimating request, the estimator _must_ begin reviewing the request. From here, there are two paths...

The estimator must request the details through [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) following these steps:

1. Tag the requestor in the comment
1. List the additional details needed
1. Assign comment to the requestor
1. Add the tag of 'question' to the task

Once the requestor provides the details, repeat the Assessment step until no additional details are required to complete the estimating task.

#### No Additional Details Needed...

The estimator must notify the requestor within [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/) when the estimate will be ready for internal review following these steps:

1. Tag the requestor in the comment
1. Inform the requestor what date they will receive the estimate (this cannot be farther out than 24 hours from the current date)
1. Set the task due date to be the same as above

### 4. Build & Respond

Once all the details are gathered and before the due date, the estimator will build the estimate and provide the estimated hours to the requestor via [ClickUp](/tools/clickup/).
