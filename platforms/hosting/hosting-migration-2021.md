## Site Testing

After sites are initially moved to their new Chimera VPS, testing must be done to ensure the sites are functioning and appearing as expected.

In order to test the sites, you will need to temporarily set the DNS for a site using your local `hosts` file. To do that, follow these steps:

1. [Open](#how-to-open-the-hosts-file) & [edit](#how-to-format-the-hosts-file) your computer's `hosts` file
1. [Confirm](#how-to-test-the-hosts-file-changes) the `hosts` file changes are in place and working
1. Test the website's functionality and appearance
1. Once tested, mark the 'Testing Results' column in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1duk6oSMVem-U9xJtb4PUWXWMlXjUDCvqOOCsyT7j-ZU/edit#gid=2028465986" target="_blank">Migration Tracking spreadsheet</a> with the proper response
1. If issues are found during testing, describe the issues within the 'Testing Notes' column in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1duk6oSMVem-U9xJtb4PUWXWMlXjUDCvqOOCsyT7j-ZU/edit#gid=2028465986" target="_blank">Migration Tracking spreadsheet</a>
