# Hosting

Our web hosting is currently comprised of three services, all provided by Liquid Web.

## Chimera Server (2021)

Our newest hosting environment - named [Chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera) - is a dedicated server set up with four (4) separate VPS's or Virtual Private Servers.

-  **WEB01** - For high-uptime, priority websites
-  **WEB02** - Basic website hosting
-  **WEB03** - Basic website hosting
-  **GEOWEB01** - Dedicated to Geauga County websites

## Firebird Server (2015)

This has been our primary web server, containing all the websites of our hosting clients. It is a dedicated server provided by Liquid Web.

## Nexcess (2018)

This is a Managed WordPress hosting solution provided by Liquid Web. Currently, only two (2) sites reside on this hosting platform - opivision.com and petittigardencenter.com. Long-term, the plan is to move both of these sites to our Chimera server.
