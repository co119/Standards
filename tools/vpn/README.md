# Company 119 VPN Setup

## Setup Instructions

https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Client_VPN/Client_VPN_OS_Configuration

All credentials needed to access the VPN are stored in the `Shared-Client Credentials\Company 119 Internal` folder in [LastPass](../lastpass).

## Accessing the "Clients" Folder

Once connected through the VPN, you'll need to map the following network drive in order to gain access to the client folder: `\\10.10.119.10\Company 119`

## Web Portal

If you need quick access to the server, there is a web portal available at http://co119.quickconnect.to. One thing to remember is that you have to download files to your machine, so if you make file changes, your changes won’t be saved to the server unless you re-upload the file via the web portal. This process is good if you only need to view a file.

## Notes

-  You will need a separate username/password for logging into the VPN server. Most employees have accounts set up, but if you need a password reset or a new account just let [Nick Goers](mailto:nicholas@company119.com) know and he’ll get it set up ASAP.
-  Similarly, once logged in to the VPN server, you’ll need to use your server credentials to login to the shared drive. If you don’t remember those again, let [Nick Goers](mailto:nicholas@company119.com) know and he’ll reset the password.
-  If you run into any stumbling blocks, reach out to [Nick Goers](mailto:nicholas@company119.com). He will try his hardest to help get things set up correctly, but if he can’t, he’ll contact our IT vendor.
